# Mosque Finder Application
Mosque finder developed by [Yusuf Ghani](https://github.com/ChampionYusuf1) and [Ali Mohammed](https://github.com/ali-mohammed0419). Inputs user location and outputs the nearest Mosque to your location. Currently only supports locations in the Chicagoland Area.

Currently we are migrating our data storage from hard-coded integer values to a [SQLite Database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

Features:
Location Input: Accepts user’s latitude/longitude or address to identify current position.
Nearest Mosque Output: Returns the closest Mosque in the Chicagoland area.
Roadmap
SQLite Integration
  Replace hard-coded values with a properly structured SQLite database for location data.
Coverage Expansion
  Increase geographic coverage beyond Chicagoland to other cities/states.
Enhanced UI/UX
  Provide a user-friendly interface, possibly with a map view, to display locations and directions.
Mobile/Platform Support
  Explore porting the app to Android or cross-platform frameworks for on-the-go usage.
