Mosque Finder Application

Mosque Finder is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users locate the nearest mosque based on their current location. Developed by Yusuf Ghani and Ali Mohammed, this application currently supports locations within the Chicagoland area with data stored in a lightweight SQLite database.

üîç Features

Location Input: Accepts user‚Äôs latitude/longitude or address string.

Nearest Mosque Output: Calculates and returns the closest mosque in Chicagoland.

Flexible Querying: Supports both coordinate-based and geocoded address lookups.

Batch Lookup: Ability to find mosques for multiple locations in a single call.

Error Handling: Graceful fallback when no mosques are found or invalid input is provided.

Logging: Records lookup requests and results for audit and analytics.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Back-end: Python (Flask / FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)

Database: SQLite for local storage and rapid prototyping

Geocoding: Optional integration with Google Maps Geocoding API or OpenStreetMap Nominatim

Distance Calculation: Haversine formula for accurate earth-distance computation

Testing: pytest / Mocha with coverage reports

Containerization (future): Docker for consistent deployment
