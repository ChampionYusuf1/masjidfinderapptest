# manualmasjidfinderjavaapp
This app is our first app made by me and ali mohammed. This app takes in user location with their permission and puts it through algrorithms and sorting methods to find which mosque or masjid is closet to you. We are currently working on implenting a sql databse into our app to allow for faster and more effiecent sorting through the mosques coordinates
