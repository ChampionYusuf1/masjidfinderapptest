# manualmasjidfinderjavaapp
Mosque finder developed by [Yusuf Ghani](https://github.com/ChampionYusuf1) and [Ali Mohammed](https://github.com/ali-mohammed0419). Inputs user location and outputs the nearest Mosque to your location. Currently only supports locations in the Chicagoland Area.

Currently we are migrating our data storage structure from hard-coded integer values to a [SQLite Database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).
